README Akustyk 1.9.2
==========
# Source Code #
Akustyk is open-source software to be used as an add-on to [Praat](http://praat.org). The source code should work in a very similar way on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux, though installation is somewhat platform-specific.
# Installation #
As of version 1.9.2, Akustyk now complies to the Praat plug-in specification. There will no longer be automated install wizards for Windows or Mac OSX. Instead, you can install Akustyk entirely from within Praat, by running the `install.praat` script.
## Download Akustyk ##
[Download Akustyk from SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/akustyk/) and save it to your Dekstop.
## Uncompress the archive ##
The downloaded file is an archive (in a tar.gz or zip format). Uncompress it to the desktop. You should end up with the directory `plugin_akustyk' on your Desktop. It is **IMPORTANT** that this directory is on your Desktop.
## Run the installer ##
The installer is a Praat script `install.praat` that is included in the `plugin_akustyk` directory.
* Start Praat

* Open `install.praat` with the `Open Praat script... ` command from the Praat menu

* While in the Praat script Editor, go to `Run/Run`

* You will get a small dialog box. Click **OK** to install

* Restart Praat

# Uninstall #
You can remove Akustyk from your system by running the same script - `install.praat` and choosing the `Uninstall` options. This will remove Akustyk and its menus, but will preserve your data in the `session_files` directory.
